# Description of the Directory

The following directory contains the final group project of my python 101 course

The main function that I am responsible for is the option 1 in the program.

Its use is to help find different types of restaurants that are open according to the time now,
around the campus of National Chengchi University.

Now knowing the use of pandas library,
what I could have done better then, was to perhaps store the data in a pandas dataframe,
which enables easier data manipulation.

Also, I would instead store the data outside the main code in another file, 
for the purpose of tidiness of code, and convenience to add in additional data.
